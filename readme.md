# Academic Title Generator

Looking for the next great academic conference proposal title? Need ideas for an interesting research subject? You're in luck.

This randomly generates academic titles, based primarily on a corpus of over 600 titles from the 2014 [Conference on College Composition and Communication](http://www.ncte.org/cccc/conv). It also inserts key words like "postcolonialism" and "marginalization," and even sometimes includes prefixes like "meta-" and suffixes like "istic."

Some of the best titles we've generated include:

- Piloting Feminism the Brave New World
- Visions of Bifeminism an Inclusive Academy through Hipistic Hop
- Rhetoric in the Classroom and Its Potential Effects on Pedagogy
- Latin American Rhetorical Histories: Case Closed?
- All Just Get Along? Teaching That

See `picks.md` for more.

## Usage

Install the `marky_markov` gem, run `ruby main.rb`, and be prepared to be amazed by the academic titles it generates.
